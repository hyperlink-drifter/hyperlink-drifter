    - q: What sets Retro Roll apart from traditional marketing methods?
      a: Unlike traditional marketing methods that rely on passive advertising, Retro
        Roll offers a hands-on, immersive experience that allows consumers to
        interact with your brand in a memorable way. By bringing your brand
        directly to the streets, we create lasting impressions that resonate
        with consumers long after the campaign ends.
    - q: What locations can Retro Roll operate in?
      a: Retro Roll primarily operates in Southern California, covering areas from LA
        to San Diego and Palm Springs. However, our services extend to San
        Francisco and Las Vegas, making us accessible from our base in Newport
        Beach.
